       "\n",
       "In cricket, a batsman (the player at bat) can be dismissed in several ways. According to the **Laws of Cricket**, there are **ten recognized modes of dismissal**:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Bowled**: The bowler delivers the ball, and it hits the stumps, dislodging at least one bail.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Caught**: The batsman hits the ball, and it is caught by a fielder, wicketkeeper, or bowler before it touches the ground.\n",

       "3. **Leg Before Wicket (LBW)**: The ball strikes the batsmanâ€™s legs (or other parts of the body except the hand) in line with the stumps, preventing the ball from hitting the wicket.\n",

       "4. **Run Out**: A fielder breaks the wicket with the ball while the batsman is outside the crease attempting a run.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Stumped**: The wicketkeeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of the crease and not attempting a run, typically after a delivery.\n",

       "6. **Hit Wicket**: The batsman accidentally dislodges the stumps with his body or equipment while playing a shot or setting off for a run.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Hit the Ball Twice**: The batsman hits the ball a second time with his bat before the ball has been touched by a fielder, without the permission of the opposition.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Obstructing the Field**: The batsman intentionally blocks or interferes with the fielding side by word or action.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Handled the Ball**: (Now merged with \"Obstructing the Field\") The batsman deliberately touches the ball with a hand that is not in contact with the bat without the consent of the fielding side.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Timed Out**: The next batsman does not arrive at the crease within a stipulated time after a wicket has fallen.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Strikeout**:\n",
       "   - **Swinging Strikeout**: The batter swings and misses.\n",

       "2. **Fly Out**: A fielder catches a batted ball before it touches the ground.\n",

       "3. **Ground Out**: The batter hits a ground ball and the ball is fielded and thrown to first base before the batter arrives.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Force Out**: A runner is forced to advance to the next base due to the batter becoming a runner, and the defensive team successfully tags that base before the runner arrives.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Tag Out**: A fielder tags the runner with the ball when the runner is not on a base.\n",

       "6. **Double Play**: Two outs are recorded in a single continuous play, typically involving force outs or tag outs.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Triple Play**: Three outs are recorded in a single continuous play, which is rare.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Fielderâ€™s Choice**: The fielder chooses to put out a runner instead of the batter.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Interference**: The batter interferes with the play, or a coach or runner interferes, leading to an out.\n",
